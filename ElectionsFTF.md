draft.


Have the land split in 101 electoral circonscriptions. (100 representatives, 1 assembly president)
todo: prevent jerrymandering (by limiting geometricaly the shape of circonscriptions?)
During an election to determine who will be the elected representative for a circonscription, electors of a circonscription rate as many of their candidates as they wish with points from 1 (best) to n where n is the number of candidates in that circonscription.

Candidates and representatives may be a member of a party.

Winners are chosen as follows:
All ratings from all circonscriptions are added together to give each party and independant candidate a score.
Scores are the multiplicative inverse of the rating (1/rating)
