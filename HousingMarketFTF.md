Draft: Pool a vacacy chain's owners' resources together to bootstrap it.

* Seller A wants to buy from Seller B
* Seller B wants to buy from Seller C
* Seller C etc...

If one of the seller buys from one of the seller earlier in the chain, then all sellers from this starting seller to the buyer have completed the vacancy chain.

If an external benefactor buys from the first seller, then all seller have completed the vacancy chain.

Otherwise, all sellers except the first one may pool their resources to buy from the first seller. At this point the bought home becomes the property of all the buyers who then have to sell it at a later time, giving them more flexibility in the house market (moving earlier).
